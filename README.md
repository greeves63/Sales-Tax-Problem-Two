# Sales-Tax-Problem-Two
From the prompt given, the basic sales tax is at a rate of 10% on all items, except books, food, and medical products which are exempt. Import duty is an additional sales tax applicable on all imported items at a rate of 5%, and no exemptions.  Once items are purchased, a receipt is printed.
